Nows
+moving notes:
-refactor: pull up follower logic, have a seperate mouse handler component that refers to the pulled up follow state
 .many mice down for selection purposes, one mouse up logic center
-lil note follows cursor
-original note effects
-ghost note shows placement
-release to place

+refactor: use context and children to have fewer props
+refactor: organize components folder

Todo
+Add core functions
-get one note working with mock data (probably unsaved)
 .adding color
 .deleting notes
 .make look passable
-add nesting and data saving
 .idk what order to do these in

Future bugs
+why was note state updating without me needing to call the set function? should i remove it?
